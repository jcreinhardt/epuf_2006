# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Data-engineering + replication project around SSA earnings data. Two complementary sources
are loaded into one shared DuckDB database and used to replicate figures/tables from Compson
(2012), RS Note 2012-01:

- **EPUF 2006** — 1% individual **microdata** (`demographic`, `annual` tables).
- **Annual Statistical Supplement, Table 4.B1** — published annual **aggregates** (`supplement_4b1`).

`README.md` is the authoritative reference for data semantics, table schemas, and the
measurement caveats (capping, random-rounding, sparse panels, EPUF-vs-Supplement differences).
Read it before doing any analysis — the caveats materially change what queries mean.

## Environment

- Python code needs the conda env **`socsec_mac`** (`conda activate socsec_mac`); the base
  `python3` lacks the deps. Key packages: `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.
- **DuckDB is used via its CLI (`duckdb`), not a Python module.** The Python scripts
  deliberately `subprocess` out to the `duckdb` binary so they carry no `python-duckdb`
  dependency — follow this pattern rather than importing `duckdb` in Python.

## Common commands

Run everything **from the project root** (`epuf_2006/`); all paths in the code are relative to it.

Build the database (two steps, idempotent via `CREATE OR REPLACE`, order-independent):

```bash
duckdb processed_data/ssa.duckdb < code/build_epuf_duckdb.sql   # ~7 s → demographic, annual
python code/extract_table_4B1.py                                # → supplement_4b1 (+ CSV)
```

Run analysis / replication:

```bash
duckdb processed_data/ssa.duckdb < code/replicate_note_table2.sql       # Table 2 of RS Note 2012-01
duckdb processed_data/ssa.duckdb ".read code/example_panel_to_age60.sql"
python code/plot_chart4_replication.py                                  # → output/chart4_replication.pdf
```

`extract_table_4B1.py` has flags: `--no-duckdb` (write CSV only), `--html/--out/--duckdb/--table`.

## Architecture

- **Single shared DB `processed_data/ssa.duckdb`** is the integration point. Everything —
  EPUF microdata and Supplement aggregates — lives here so replication queries can `JOIN`
  microdata against the published series `USING (year)`. The two loaders each touch only
  their own tables (`CREATE OR REPLACE`), so they compose without stepping on each other.
- **`raw_data/` and `processed_data/` are large and not version-controlled.** The DB is a
  regenerable artifact — rebuild it from the raw CSVs, never hand-edit it. `raw_data/` is
  treated as read-only source data.
- **Ingestion is CSV → typed DuckDB tables** (`build_epuf_duckdb.sql`) and **saved HTML →
  CSV → DuckDB** (`extract_table_4B1.py`). The Supplement page is committed as saved HTML
  (`*.source.html`) because SSA's edge blocks non-browser fetches — parse that file, do not
  try to re-download it.

## Gotchas that will bite you

- **`annual` is a sparse panel: an absent `(id, year)` means zero covered earnings that
  year, not missing data.** Balanced-panel work must zero-fill (see `example_panel_to_age60.sql`).
- **`earnings` is top-coded** at each year's taxable maximum (plus bottom-coded and
  random-rounded). It understates true earnings, severely before ~1980. Restrict to
  `year >= 1980` for top-of-distribution analysis.
- **EPUF is a 1% sample:** scale to population by ×100 when comparing to Supplement totals
  (as the replication scripts do).
- Raw sentinel codes are normalized on load and stored as `NULL`: `sex = 3` ("unspecified")
  and `qtrs = '.'` (all 1951–52 rows). Account for these NULLs.
- In `example_panel_to_age60.sql`, `generate_series` needs **literal** age bounds, so the
  start/end ages (25/60) appear as literals in two places — keep them in sync.
